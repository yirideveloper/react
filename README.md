# Looking for Version 1?

We're in the process of rolling out v2, so that's merged into `master` now.

# What is Reactotron?

A macOS, Windows, and Linux app for inspecting your [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps.

Use it to:

* view your application state
* show API requests & responses
* perform quick performance benchmarks
* subscribe to parts of your application state
* display messages similar to `console.log`
* track global errors with source-mapped stack traces including saga stack traces!
* dispatch actions like a government-run mind control experiment
* hot swap your app's state using Redux or mobx-state-tree
* track your sagas
* show image overlay in React Native
* track your Async Storage in React Native

You plug it into your app as a dev dependency so it adds nothing to your product builds.
